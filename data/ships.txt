	description "Though the Remnant don't have enough territory to warrant large patrol fleets, some particularly expansionist Remnant captains have, for a long time, worked towards the goal of creating a suitable flagship for mining fleets. Named for its long time coming and its enormous size, the Dasornis is a capable warship all by itself, while also being able to serve and carry multiple wings of support craft."
	description "	Though it lacks a cloaking device, and is rather slow, the Dasornis is a remarkably durable ship, able to absorb considerable punishmment while its carry complement dismantles whatever ship happens to be posing a threat to the mining operation. As a capital ship, however, the Dasornis is rarely under the operation of a single Remnant captain; much to the chagrin of some."
	description "	Further cementing its intended use as a mining craft, the Dasornis has some asteroid scanning capability integrated into its hull, along with the more standard Remnant sensor suite."

	description `At first glance, this heavily modified Spire is quite odd; laughable, even. However, a closer look will reveal the cause of such a bizarre design; acres of docking clamps for fighters, allowing the ship to house a veritable armada of fifty fighters. Though it's extremely slow at maximum capacity, it is nonetheless capable of transporting vast amounts of personnel and materiel thanks to its complement of over four dozen Sliver-class fighters.`
	description `Compared to the base Spire, the Branch had to have some of its weapon systems removed in compliance with Heliarch concerns. However, instead of letting that back-end space go to waste, extra effort was made to improve the Branch's engines, in the hopes of making it move at a tolerable speed. Despite its very sluggish movement speed, it is still used by some captains, as one fully-loaded Branch is capable of moving more passengers and cargo than any other ship in coalition space.`

	description `Developed alongside the Branch, the Sliver is a Kimek Thorn that has been trimmed down to fit snugly onto the docking clamps of the Branch. As a sort of multipurpose courier, Slivers are traditionally sold with exactly 20 outfit space reserved for a captain's personal choice of expansions: Either a Bunk Room, or a Cargo Expansion, allowing each ship to be tailored to the individual needs of the fleet in the moment. Of course, in the event of a Quarg invasion, these refits could be swapped out for a single small weapon; a fact that becomes very dangerous when you remember the ships are typically bundled into flights of more than 2 dozen.`

	description "The Pai Lek 36 appears to have been built around a single concept: Utilise a fast, easily-constructable platform to provide a large amount of long-ranged fire support as cheaply as possible. Armed with a single Korath Detainer, these ships can be deployed in great numbers to cripple even the fastest ship's engines, allowing other ships in a Sestor fleet to rip apart the pinned target with shorter-ranged weapons."
	description "Despite being built for long-ranged combat, the Pai Lek 31 still sports a rather robust hull, suggesting that earlier models may have been intended to fight closer to the fray, where the ship might be in danger."

#	description "The Remnant have long favoured turns of action that avoid putting crew directly at risk; though their Terns are a rather effective result of this ideology, the remnant still had to face the fact that, eventually, one of their manned ships was going to end up too crippled to escape to safety. To that end, the Smew was developed: Though quite lightly armed, Smews are capable of carrying a considerable quantity of cargo and passengers for a ship of their size, and are durable enough to absorb some fire from enemies while doing so."
#	description "	Though originally designed as lifeboats, the surprisingly mobile freighter-fighter hybrid has seen a remarkable amount of usage in mining fleets, as a way to supplement the otherwise poor cargo capacity of the Ibis. Because their purpose can vary from fleet to fleet, Smews are traditionally sold with a fair amount of free space; enough for a small weapon, upgraded engines, or additional support systems."
#	description "	Fighters do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a fighter unless you have a ship in your fleet with a fighter bay."

	description "Though their main worlds are all very centralized, their scout and patrol vessels occasionally have an emergency need for supplies, crew, or new Petrels and Terns that most of their ships will not be able to sate in a timely manner. This has lead to the development of the Stork; it is a rather delicate vessel, with little in the way of capacity for weaponry, but it is considerably faster than all but the smallest of the Remnant's ships, while also bearing a cloak that allows it to sneak by any foes attempting to disrupt supply lines."
	description "	Though too lightly armed to be an appreciable warship or miner by itself, some remnant captains creatively use the ship as a mining carrier in place of the more expensive Ibis. The cloaking capability allows it to hide in the event a dangerous foe comes into play, meaning that the Stork fares remarkably well in riskier regions of space."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Stork's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."

	description "The Remnant are not an ilk with the luxury of being able to peacefully negotiate with many species, but should they require a vessel for large-scale negotiation, this enormous beast of a ship is their chosen vessel. The Turtle Dove has the capacity to house a small colony's population of diplomats, as well as large enough cargo holds to suit the demands of any negotiation; all wrapped up in a hull more than twice the durability of an Albatross."
	description "The Turtle Dove is not as advanced as some remnant ships in terms of intelligence, and its on-board scanners are somewhat inadequate for a ship of its size; however, the ship contains spiracle-like structures that allow it to cycle heat out via large gas ballasts located deep within its hull."
	description "As a peace vessel, the Turtle Dove carries no offensive weaponry; only anti-missile turrets that allow it to cast a wide field of missile denial over any allies it may be escorting."
